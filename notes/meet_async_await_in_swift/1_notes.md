Calling synchronous function blocks your thread.

Asynchronous function unblocks your thread. Asynchronous function uses completion handler or delegate callback to notify the result.

Now you can mark a function async and just return a result.

You can also throw an error in an async function.

Async/await in Swift makes code safer, shorter, and makes it better reflect your intent.
